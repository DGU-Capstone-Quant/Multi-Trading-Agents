  "history_tail": "Bear Analyst: Bull Analyst's argument is fundamentally flawed. While the MACD line is above its signal, the MACD values remain negative, underscoring persistent bearish momentum. An RSI of 39.59 is not oversold and merely indicates weakness, not an imminent rebound. The price is below the 10 EMA, 50 SMA, and 200 SMA, confirming a robust downtrend. Claiming a \"temporary pullback\" without fundamental or news support is pure speculation. This is a clear SELL.",
