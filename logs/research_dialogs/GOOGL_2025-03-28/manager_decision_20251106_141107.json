    "decision": "SELL",
    "rationale": "A complete absence of fundamental data, specific negative sentiment, or news is a black box, inherently un-investable. Investing now, solely on the hope of future 'positive catalysts,' is pure speculation, not a calculated risk. The downside in such an information vacuum is 100% capital loss.",
    "plan": "Avoid investment in this opportunity due to the complete lack of fundamental data. Revisit the opportunity if and when discernible signals or fundamental data become available for evaluation. Focus on opportunities with transparent data for calculated risk assessment."
