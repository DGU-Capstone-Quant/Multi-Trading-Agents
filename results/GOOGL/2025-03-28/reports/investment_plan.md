# Investment Plan (GOOGL / 2025-03-28)

**Decision:** SELL

## Rationale
The overwhelming bearish alignment of multiple key moving averages (10 EMA < 50 SMA < 200 SMA) indicates a strong and persistent downtrend. While momentum indicators like MACD and RSI suggest a potential for a short-term bounce, these signals are weak and unconfirmed within the dominant bearish context. The risk of further downside outweighs the potential for a fleeting rebound.

## Plan
Initiate a 'SELL' position. Monitor price action closely, especially for any sustained breakout above the 10-day EMA, which could signal a temporary shift in momentum. Re-evaluate the position if the RSI moves into confirmed oversold territory (below 30) or if the MACD shows stronger positive divergence with price action. Focus on protecting capital in a clear downtrend.
