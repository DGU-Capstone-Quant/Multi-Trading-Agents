# Investment Plan (GOOGL / 2025-03-28)

**Decision:** HOLD

## Rationale
While the MACD shows a bullish crossover and a positive histogram, suggesting a potential shift in momentum, the stock price remains significantly below all key moving averages (50 SMA, 200 SMA, 10 EMA), indicating a strong and confirmed downtrend. The RSI is approaching oversold but has not yet reached it, failing to provide a strong enough signal for an immediate bounce. Given the conflicting signals and the dominance of the bearish trend, a 'HOLD' position is prudent to avoid premature entry or exit.

## Plan
Monitor GOOGL's price action closely, especially its interaction with the 10-day EMA and RSI levels. If the price breaks above the 10-day EMA and the RSI drops into confirmed oversold territory followed by a bounce, it would provide stronger evidence for a reversal. Conversely, if the price continues to fall, breaching lower support levels, the bearish trend will be further confirmed. Re-evaluate in 24 hours.
