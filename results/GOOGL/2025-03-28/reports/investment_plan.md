# Investment Plan (GOOGL / 2025-03-28)

**Decision:** HOLD

## Rationale
While both analysts present valid points, the bull's argument for long-term growth is compelling, yet the bear's concern about the absence of specific, current fundamental data is critical for making an immediate, informed decision. Without current data on market sentiment, news, or fundamental metrics, a definitive 'BUY' or 'SELL' carries undue risk.

## Plan
Maintain current portfolio allocation. Initiate a thorough research process to gather specific market reports, sentiment analysis, fundamental data for key sectors and companies, and current macroeconomic indicators (inflation, interest rates, geopolitical stability). Re-evaluate the decision to BUY, SELL, or continue to HOLD based on the gathered, actionable data within the next 2-4 weeks.
