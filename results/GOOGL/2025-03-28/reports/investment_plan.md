# Investment Plan (GOOGL / 2025-03-28)

**Decision:** SELL

## Rationale
The overwhelming bearish trend, evidenced by the price trading significantly below all key moving averages, outweighs the weak bullish signals from the MACD crossover in deeply negative territory and an RSI only approaching oversold.

## Plan
Initiate a short position on GOOGL. Monitor price action closely, especially around the 10 EMA (165.12) and RSI towards the 30 level, for any stronger reversal indications that would warrant covering the short.
