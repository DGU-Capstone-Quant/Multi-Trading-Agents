# Investment Plan (GOOGL / 2025-03-28)

**Decision:** SELL

## Rationale
The predominant bearish trend, confirmed by all major moving averages (10 EMA, 50 SMA, 200 SMA), overrides the early and weak bullish signals from MACD and RSI. Attempting to catch a 'falling knife' based on nascent, unconfirmed momentum shifts is high-risk.

## Plan
Initiate a sell position on GOOGL. Monitor price action closely, especially for confirmation of a true reversal via sustained breaks above key moving averages, before reconsidering the position. Set a stop-loss order to mitigate further downside risk if the trend unexpectedly reverses upwards.
